= GraphBLAS in Java Benchmarks

Master Thesis project comparing different graph-algorithms written in gds-pregel and ejml against existing once in  JGraphT and GDS.

*Relies on locally build ejml, gds and graphblas-java-native*


== Setting up the project

=== Prerequisites

* java (tested with openjdk 11.0.8 via sdkman)
* mvn
* git

# starting from this directory
cd ..

# ejml (my fork as not everythink is in the main-repo)
git clone git@github.com:FlorentinD/ejml.git
cd ejml/
git checkout mask_rebased
./gradlew autogenerate
./gradlew install

# SuiteSparse:Graphblas (make sure to install under `usr/local` and you might not need setting the LD_LIBRARY_PATH)
git clone git@github.com:DrTimothyAldenDavis/GraphBLAS.git
cd GraphBLAS/
make JOBS=32
sudo make install -j32 INSTALL=/usr/local/
cd ..

# graphblas-java-native
git@github.com:fabianmurariu/graphblas-java-native.git
cd graphblas-java-native/
cd graphblas-java/
# this might need a restart to work
mvn clean install
cd ..
mvn clean install -Dgpg.skip
cd ..

# run benchmarks (exclude, include benchmarks via build.gradle)
cd GraphBlasInJavaBenchmarks/
./gradlew :jmh --no-daemon
